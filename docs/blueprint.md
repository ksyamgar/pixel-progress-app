# **App Name**: Pixel Progress

## Core Features:

- Goal Setting: Allow users to define daily goals with associated XP values, and to divide tasks into sub-tasks, also with individual XP values.
- Time Management: Enable users to set time allocations for each task, schedule reminder notifications, and the ability to extend task durations as needed.
- AI Rival XP Customization: Implement an AI Rival feature where the rival gains XP based on the user's inactivity or missed goals. Configure the rival's XP gain through a customizable tool that can be adjusted (e.g., hourly, percentage of user's XP).
- AI Rival: A customizable tool enabling configuration of how AI rivals gain XP (e.g., hourly, percentage of user's XP, daily flat rate).
- XP Tracking: Display real-time XP progress for both the user and their AI Rival to provide immediate feedback and motivation.
- History/Calendar: A Calendar view which enable the user to view and 'revive' or redo the old tasks in calendar view so that the user could redeem back the XP again. Each created task is saved in history so user can just use them again without needing to write again

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#9D4EDD) to reflect a sense of progress and digital energy. Evokes feeling of being present in this new media digital age while referencing Eke Red inspiration from Pok√©mon.
- Background color: Dark, desaturated purple (#2E1A47) to provide a high contrast backdrop for the neon elements and to maintain a pixel-art game feel.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#579BB1) to highlight interactive elements and XP gains, creating visual interest. Also creates balance of cool to offset intense main primary hue.
- Pixel-style font to align with the pixel-art aesthetic of the app.
- Simple, geometric icons, reminiscent of 8-bit graphics, to represent different types of tasks.
- Glassmorphism effect on panels and buttons to provide a modern, frosted glass appearance, softening the harshness of pixel art.
- Subtle, pixelated animations to signal task completion or XP gain.
